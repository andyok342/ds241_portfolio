## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
install.packages("here")
install.packages("readr")
install.packages("dsbox")
library(tidyverse)
library(clean)
library(dsbox)
library(readr)
library(here)

states <- read_csv("data_raw/states.csv")

## Dataset of Dennys and Laquinta are download from dsbox package

## Exercise 1
nrow(dennys)
ncol(dennys)

## Exercise 2
nrow(laquinta)
ncol(laquinta)

## Exercise 3
# Laquinta and Dennys are in dozens of countrys. 

## Exericse 4
laquinta |>
  filter(country)
dennys |>
  filter(country)

## Exercise 5
dennys %>%
  filter(!(state %in% states$abbreviation))

## Exercise 6
dennys %>%
  mutate(country = "United States")

## Exercise 7
# Besides US, Laquinta are in Canada, Mexico and Honduras.

## Exercise 8
laquinta %>%
  mutate(country = case_when(
    state %in% state.abb     ~ "United States",
    state %in% c("ON", "BC") ~ "Canada",
    state == "ANT"           ~ "Colombia",
    state == "MEX"   ~ "Mexico",                    
  ))

laquinta <- laquinta %>%
  filter(country == "United States")
```

```{r cars}
## Exercise 9 (Not in ascedning order)
laquinta |> count(state, Sort = TRUE)
#Texas is the max and Vegas is the min
```

```{r cars}
dennys |> count(state, sort = TRUE)
# Califorina has the most and Delaware has the least.

```

```{r cars}
## Exercise 10 

dennys <- dennys %>%
  mutate(establishment = "Denny's")

laquinta <- laquinta %>%
  mutate(establishment = "La Quinta")

dn_lq <- bind_rows(dennys, laquinta)

p <- ggplot(dn_lq, mapping = aes(x = longitude, y = latitude, color = establishment)) +
  geom_point() 

p + labs(title = "Denny and Laquinta in U.S.", subtitle = "Their locations in U.S.")

```

```{r cars}
## Exercise 11
dennys_NC <- dennys %>%
  filter(state == "NC")
dennys_NC <- dennys_NC %>%
  mutate(establishment = "Denny's")

laquinta_NC <- laquinta %>%
  filter(state == "NC")
laquinta_NC <- laquinta_NC %>%
  mutate(establishment = "La Quinta")

dn_lq <- bind_rows(dennys_NC, laquinta_NC)

p <- ggplot(dn_lq, mapping = aes(x = longitude, y = latitude, color = establishment)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6) 

p + labs(title = "Denny and Laquinta in U.S.", subtitle = "Denny and Laquinta locations in North Carolina")

## Mitch joke doesn't seem to hold up here, because theirs only one location that are overlap. 

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure}
## Exercise 12
dennys_TX <- dennys %>%
  filter(state == "TX")
dennys_TX <- dennys_TX %>%
  mutate(establishment = "Denny's")

laquinta_TX <- laquinta %>%
  filter(state == "TX")
laquinta_TX <- laquinta_TX %>%
  mutate(establishment = "La Quinta")

dn_lq <- bind_rows(dennys_TX, laquinta_TX)

p <- ggplot(dn_lq, mapping = aes(x = longitude, y = latitude, color = establishment)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) 

p + labs(title = "Denny and Laquinta in U.S.", subtitle = "Denny and Laquinta locations in Texas")

## Mitch jokesseem to correct here, because several locations where their both next to each other. 

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
